# TLBSimulator

Project developed by  [@MahatKC](https://www.github.com/MahatKC) and [@AmandaIsrael](https://www.github.com/AmandaIsrael) in pair programming in 2022.

This project was an assignment for the Operating Systems course we took in our 4th year of Computer Science.

Coded entirely in Python, it simulates how a TLB works, evaluating its efficiency based on different trace files provided by the course's professor.
